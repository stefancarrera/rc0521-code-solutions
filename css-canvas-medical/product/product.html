        <h1>It's the foundation for patient-<br>centered primary care.</h1>

          <h2>It puts care at your command</h2>
          <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flue shot or bounce around five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.</p>

          <p><im>"Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically on key quality metrics, and its incredibly easy to use. The right information is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide."</im></p>

Which of my patients are on potentially unsafe levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines? That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our old system! Canvas is light-years ahead."</im>

          <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
          <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand performance, but they aren't enough to improve quailty and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quailty protocols and change capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.</p>

We're a small practice and we don't have a big quailty team or a group of coders to catching everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance"</im>
